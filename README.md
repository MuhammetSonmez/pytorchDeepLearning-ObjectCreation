#Object Creation Prototype

This project contains a prototype of an artificial intelligence model aimed at creating objects with specific attributes. This prototype may produce simpler results due to the limited dataset. However, with a larger dataset and further training of the model, better results can be achieved.

## Features

- Facilitates the mapping between images and text files in the dataset.
- Encodes labels and prepares the dataset.
- Creates a custom dataset class using PyTorch.
- Defines and trains an artificial neural network model.
- Generates objects with specific attributes using the trained model.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Install the necessary libraries (`torch`, `torchvision`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
3. Upload the dataset to a specific directory and update the file paths in the code.
4. Train the model by running the `main.py` file and observe the results.
5. Use the `main()` function to generate objects with specific attributes using the trained model as needed.

## Development and Improvement

- This project is a prototype and may require further development to achieve better results.
- Training the model with a larger dataset can improve the accuracy of the results.
- Experimenting with the model's architecture, hyperparameters, and training process can lead to better outcomes.
